# Project Summary
<p align="justify">
A visualisation dashboard to support an interactive geo-demographic exploration of healthcare data with a specific focus on the hip fracture care scheme in Ireland. The tool uses Java web technologies (e.g. JSF) along with the popular Bootstrap framework for responsive UI.
The dataset acquired was not voluminous, however the key challenge was the variety of data sources to integrate. In particular, we had to deal with four data sources as follows: i) Irish Hip Fracture Database (IHFD), ii) Population statistics, ii) Primary care records, and iv) Care incidents records. Some of the data sources were well-structured and of high quality (e.g. IHFD), while others were mainly collected in Excel/CSV files that suffered from quality issues (e.g. erroneous/missing fields).

The dashboard was designed as a web-based tool with rich UI functionality. We mainly used Java web technologies (e.g. JSF and PrimeFaces components) along with the popular Bootstrap framework for enabling a smoothly responsive UI. The dashboard visualisations were utilised in a couple of our publications as below:
